# ToDoApp

This is a ToDoApp that stores and displays Tasks defined by the user.

By clicking on Add New Task, a form opens up, where the user enters the Tasks name(mandatory field)
and chooses date (optionally filed),adds description(optional field).

The user also has the option of assigning the importance of the task.
By choosing high importance the task gets a red border;
by choosing medium the task gets a yellow border; low importance tasks get no border.

Users can delete the task, the app also utilizes localStorage, so the tasks stay on the site even when the browser is closed and reopened.
